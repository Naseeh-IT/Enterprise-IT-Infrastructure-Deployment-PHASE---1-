Folder Sharing Structure Example

-----------------------------------------------------------

- HR Department folder: Accessible and listable by all HR group users.

Inside HR folder: Individual user folders (e.g., Arun Kumar) where users   cannot delete the folder but can delete items inside.

- Common file sharing folder: Accessible only to HR group users for sharing files.

- IT Admins have full control to delete files, while users cannot delete files in the common folder.

- All department groups have access and write permissions as appropriate.

*** 

This setup ensures secure, organized, and efficient file sharing across departments, with tailored permissions to meet organizational needs.
